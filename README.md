# candyBar
This is candyBar, a Lightweight CSS grid system.

The goal of candyBar is to deliver a usable responsive grid system with no style complications.
After using bootstrap I quickly realized that any kind of customization required far too much
work when all I really wanted was the grid system. Thus candyBar was born.
